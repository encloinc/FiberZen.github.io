## What is Fiber Zen
Fiber Zen will be a new, revolutionary scratch "OS" revolved around the community! It will have a revolutionary UI, while also retaining the usability and practicality of previous versions of Fiber OS.

## Development
We are currently in the Design Concept stage of development! Next will be the first level programming, which is making the basics of the OS, such as opening apps, and setting the home button to go to the correct wallpaper, or mode.

## History
Fiber was an "OS" developed by a scratch user, n25. The last Fiber version developed by him was fiber OS 5.10. Than a team was assembled to create a new version of Fiber OS, Fiber Nova. Fiber Nova was revolved around the cloud. The scratch cloud was slow, so an external server along with the scratch api was the best way to go, until the scratch cloud services quit. They simply stop being nearly usable, and Fiber Nova crashed. 


## Whats Different from Nova
Fiber Zen, unlike Nova, is not based around the cloud. We may have a server, but it will not be the center-peice of the OS, but rather a possible feature, so if the cloud is too slow, crashes, or quits, Fiber Zen will be able to continue development, rather than end development.
