          History
        </h3>
        <h5>
          <center>
         Fiber was an "OS" developed by a scratch user, n25. The last Fiber version developed by him was fiber OS 5.10. Than a team was assembled to create a new version of Fiber OS, Fiber Nova. Fiber Nova was revolved around the cloud. The scratch cloud was slow, so an external server along with the scratch api was the best way to go, until the scratch cloud services quit. They simply stop being nearly usable, and Fiber Nova crashed.
